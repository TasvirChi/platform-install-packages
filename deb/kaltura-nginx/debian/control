Description: Nginx web/proxy server - for Borhan
 Nginx ("engine X") is a high-performance web and reverse proxy server
 created by Igor Sysoev. It can be used both as a standalone web server
 and as a proxy to reduce the load on back-end HTTP or mail servers.
 .
 This package provides the autolearning daemon and web user interface for
 nginx's naxsi module.
 .
 It includes an interceptor (listening on TCP port 8080), which monitors
 HTTP requests from naxsi, and an extractor (running on TCP port 8081),
 which reads the database and prints reports about blocked requests.
