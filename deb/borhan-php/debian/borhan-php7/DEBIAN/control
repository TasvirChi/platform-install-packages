Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (metapackage)
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees that you
 have at least one of the four server-side versions of the PHP7 interpreter
 installed. Removing this package won't remove PHP7 from your system, however
 it may remove other packages that depend on this one.

 PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used
 open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
 for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
